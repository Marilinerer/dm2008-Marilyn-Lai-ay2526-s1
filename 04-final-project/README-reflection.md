Notes:
We have included both the p5js version and the arduino version, with 2 videos demonstrating each project.

The controls for the computer version are 'f' to push the bubbles and holding down 'r' to squish the bubbles.

For our final assignment, our concept began with the idea of creating “interactive bubbles.” Using Arduino touch force sensors, we wanted to design an experience that was visually soothing and responsive. When users pressed the sensor, the bubbles would disperse; when released, the bubbles would slowly drift back into the canvas, creating a sense of calm movement.

We started by referencing earlier class exercises, particularly Activity 4B: Objects in Motion. Building on that foundation, we created a system of “agents” to represent bubbles that moved independently. We modified the system to react to live sensor input instead of pre-set changes. This way, the bubble movement, dispersal distance, and speed depended directly on the user’s touch pressure. The stronger the force applied, the faster and farther the bubbles spread before gently returning once the pressure was released.

Along the way, our project ran into some Arduino connectivity issues. Alternatively, we tried to make them squish when force was applied to the sensor rather than leave the screen (which still happens via F-key). As the project evolved, we also integrated meditative sounds to strengthen the sense of atmosphere. 

Beyond creating something aesthetically pleasing, we wanted to explore a quiet narrative about recurrence. The bubbles became a metaphor for life’s ebb and flow, with moments of disruption followed by expected movements. Through this project, we learnt how code, interaction and physical computing can come together to express a simple but emotive concept. It was rewarding to set up the Arduino, and fascinating to see our idea move from a virtual concept (a few lines of code on a screen) to a tangible, interactive experience that people could physically engage with. Upon feedback, Joanne had also mentioned using a ball that can squish which could house the force sensor for a more tactile feel.
